# personal-portfolio-demo
A simple personal portfolio website template where participants can customize sections (e.g., name, description, skills) and use GitHub Pages to host it. This will help them get hands-on experience with GitHubâ€™s core features like forking, branching, committing changes, and creating pull requests.


# Personal Portfolio Demo

Welcome to the Personal Portfolio Demo! This is a simple template for a personal portfolio website that you can customize.

## Instructions:

1. **Fork this Repository**  
   Click the "Fork" button at the top right to create a copy of this repository under your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Once forked, create a new branch (e.g., `feature/your-name` or `update/about-me`).

3. **Customize the Website**  
   - Edit `index.html` to add your name, description, and contact details.  
   - Edit `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, and styles to match your personal brand.  
   - Add a new image to the `images/` folder (replace `profile.jpg`).

4. **Commit Your Changes**  
   After making changes, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., "Updated portfolio with my details").

5. **Create a Pull Request**  
   Once you're done, create a pull request to merge your changes from your branch to the `main` branch. (This step can be done only if you want to contribute to the original repo or share your customizations with others!)

6. **Using Github Pages**:  
   Use **GitHub Pages** to host your website by enabling GitHub Pages under the repository settings. Once activated, you'll get a URL where others can view your personal portfolio.

## Why Forking and Branching Are Important:
- **Forking**: Allows you to work on your own version of a project without affecting the original repository. Ideal for open-source contributions.
- **Branching**: Helps you keep features, fixes, or experiments isolated in separate branches, making it easier to collaborate and organize your work.

### Next Steps:
